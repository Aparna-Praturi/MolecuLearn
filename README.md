> Machine learning pipeline to recognize Down’s Syndrome and treatment effects in mice based on protein expression data.  
> Combines machine learning, hyperparameter optimization, and biological interpretability (SHAP, PCA, t-SNE, PDP).

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes **mice protein expression** data to classify subjects by their:
- **Genotype** (Control or Down’s Syndrome, Ts65Dn)
- **Treatment** (Memantine or saline)
- **Behavioral conditioning** (Context-shock or Shock-context)

Dataset source: [UCI ML Repository – *Mice Protein Expression Dataset*](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mice+Protein+Expression)  
Original study: *Higuera et al., PLOS ONE (2015)(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129126)

The goal is to build an **explainable ML model** that reveals how molecular-level protein differences encode genotype and treatment outcomes.

##  Model Interpretation & Biological Insights

This section summarizes findings from SHAP, t-SNE, and protein-level analyses.

###  Top Influential Proteins (SHAP Analysis)

| Protein | Role | Interpretation |
|----------|------|----------------|
| **APP_N** | Amyloid precursor protein | Overexpressed in Ts65Dn due to gene triplication; signals altered neurodevelopment. |
| **SOD1_N** | Oxidative stress defense | Elevated in Ts65Dn; reflects chronic oxidative stress. |
| **pCAMKII_N** | Synaptic plasticity | Decreased in Ts65Dn; Memantine restores partially. |
| **nNOS_N** | Neurotransmission | Reduced nitric oxide signaling; impaired excitability. |
| **CaNA_N** | Calcium signaling | Reduced in Ts65Dn, improves with learning and treatment. |

> SHAP confirms that **oxidative stress (SOD1)** and **synaptic signaling (pCAMKII, CaNA)** dominate the molecular distinction between healthy and Down’s mice.

###  t-SNE Visualization — Class Separability

- t-SNE shows **two main superclusters** corresponding to Control and Ts65Dn genotypes.  
- Within each genotype, **Memantine-treated** and **saline** subgroups cluster separately but overlap, reflecting subtle treatment effects.

> **Interpretation:**  
> Genotype defines the major protein-expression manifold, while treatment shifts the Ts65Dn distribution toward control-like regions — indicating **partial molecular normalization**.




---

###  Protein-Level Comparison (Control vs Ts65Dn)
![Placeholder: insert Control vs Ts65Dn bar plot here](results/proteins%20reflecting%20genotype%20diff.png)

Control vs Ts65Dn (untreated) under identical conditions shows:
- **Down-regulation:** pCAMKII, CaNA, nNOS → weaker plasticity & calcium signaling  
- **Up-regulation:** SOD1, APP → oxidative stress and amyloid elevation  

> These changes are consistent with the Down’s molecular phenotype — reduced synaptic strength, increased oxidative load.


---

### Behavior-Linked Protein Dynamics (Learning in Control Mice)

![Placeholder: insert learning behavior bar plot here](results/protein%20change%20with%20learning%20normal.png)

Learning behavior triggers:
- ↓ **SOD1, AKT, pCAMKII** → reduced oxidative/metabolic signaling  
- ↑ **CaNA, APP** → homeostatic calcium regulation and synaptic remodeling  

> Healthy mice show **adaptive downregulation of stress proteins** and **upregulation of synaptic regulators**, representing an efficient learning signature.



---

###  Memantine-Induced Molecular Restoration (Ts65Dn)

After Memantine + learning stimulation:
- **↑ CaNA, pCAMKII, SOD1** → restored calcium and synaptic balance  
- **↓ AKT, APP** → normalized metabolism and amyloid expression  

> Memantine induces a **partial rescue of Down’s molecular deficits**, promoting a shift toward control-like plasticity dynamics.

---

###  Oxidative Stress Dynamics (SOD1 Distributions)


- In control mice, **SOD1 decreases sharply during learning**, indicating lowered oxidative stress.  
- In Ts65Dn mice, **SOD1 remains high**, even with learning — showing persistent redox imbalance.  

### Interpretation by Protein:

![Placeholder: insert SOD1 histogram comparison here](results/partial_dependency.png)
1️⃣ APP_N (Amyloid Precursor Protein)

For control groups (c-*): increasing APP_N → decreases model probability.

For Ts65Dn groups (t-*): increasing APP_N → increases probability.

✅ Interpretation:

APP overexpression is characteristic of Ts65Dn (Down’s) and detrimental in controls.
The model learns that higher APP_N values push classification toward Down’s groups, consistent with its chromosome 21 triplication origin.

2️⃣ SOD1_N (Superoxide Dismutase 1)

Low to mid SOD1 levels correspond to control-like predictions.

Higher SOD1 expression increases predicted probability of Down’s / stress-related states.

✅ Interpretation:

SOD1 behaves as an oxidative stress marker — higher values align with the Ts65Dn phenotype.
In control groups, learning conditions reduce SOD1 dependency (flatter slopes), suggesting oxidative stabilization.

3️⃣ pCAMKII_N (Phosphorylated CaMKII)

Negative slope for all groups → higher pCAMKII_N lowers Down’s likelihood.

Most pronounced in treated groups (t-SC-m, t-CS-m).

✅ Interpretation:

pCAMKII is a learning-associated kinase — its activation indicates healthy synaptic plasticity.
The model identifies higher pCAMKII_N as a protective signature (closer to control profiles).
Memantine-treated Ts65Dn mice show mild recovery of this pattern, aligning with observed synaptic rescue.

4️⃣ CaNA_N (Calcineurin A)

Positive slope in controls; negative slope in Ts65Dn conditions.

Indicates opposite regulatory roles depending on genotype.

✅ Interpretation:

CaNA supports calcium-dependent dephosphorylation and synaptic resetting.
Control mice benefit from higher CaNA levels post-learning, but Ts65Dn mice show inverse coupling — suggesting impaired calcium homeostasis.
After Memantine, slope flattens → partial normalization.

5️⃣ AKT_N (Protein Kinase B)

Generally positive slope: higher AKT_N increases class probability across both genotypes.

But amplitude smaller in control conditions.

✅ Interpretation:

AKT activity reflects metabolic and growth signaling.
Overactivation is a known feature in Down’s models; the model’s sensitivity shows that elevated AKT_N pushes predictions toward Ts65Dn classes.
Memantine dampens this dependency slightly (flatter curves).

###  Cross-Condition Insights

| **Protein** | **Control (c-*)** | **Ts65Dn (t-*)** | **Biological Implication** |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| **APP_N** | ↓ probability | ↑ probability | Overexpression drives Down’s classification |
| **SOD1_N** | ↓ probability | ↑ probability | Oxidative stress marker |
| **pCAMKII_N** | ↓ probability | ↓ probability | Low levels impair plasticity; higher = healthier |
| **CaNA_N** | ↑ probability | ↓ probability | Reversed calcium regulation |
| **AKT_N** | ↑ probability (mild) | ↑ probability (strong) | Hypermetabolic state in Down’s |


✅ Interpretation summary:

These PDPs reveal nonlinear, directionally consistent patterns:

APP, SOD1, and AKT promote Down’s-like classification.

pCAMKII and CaNA promote Control-like classification.

Memantine treatment smooths these transitions — indicating biological normalization.


---

##  Final Summary

> **Normal learning:** Downregulation of stress pathways + enhancement of calcium signaling  
> **Down’s phenotype:** Elevated oxidative and amyloid proteins + suppressed plasticity  
> **Memantine effect:** Partial normalization — increases in CaNA and pCAMKII, decreases in APP and AKT  

Together, these results show that **protein-level restoration mirrors behavioral recovery**, confirming the biological validity of the ML findings.
